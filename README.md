# Aurelius.

> "No man is free who is not master of himself." - Epictetus

### The Concept
Aurelius is a minimalist, ephemeral morning journal for the Stoic mind.

In an era of digital hoarding, Aurelius enforces scarcity. Users receive **one** daily prompt derived from Stoic philosophy.

**The Constraint** The user has a strictly limited window (5 minutes) to answer. Once saved, the entry is immutable. The ink is dry. This forces clarity of thought over perfectionism.

### The Stack
* React(Vite) + Tailwind CSS for Frontend
* Minimalist typographic interface (EB Garamond) for the Design
* Local persistence (mvp)/MongoDB (Planned v2)

### Why I built this
I wanted a tool to clear my head before engineering sprints that didn't distract me with complex UI or social features. I believe software should sometimes do *less* to help us focus *more*.
